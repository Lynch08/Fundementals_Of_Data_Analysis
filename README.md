This Repository contains an overview if the matplotlib.pyplot package in a juypter notebook for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module(GMIT - Wimter 2021)

## Table of Contents

## Planned Project Outcomes
1. To break the project down into small manageable tasks
2. To gain an understanding of the matplotlib.pyplot package
3. To integrate the skills I had acquired so far in this course to visualise and analyse my "datasets", and display my findings
4. To expand my knowledge of the python libraries and tools to make the code as simple and readable as possible for the reader
5. To learn how to best optimise my time between research, programming, problem-solving and analysis.

## The Task and Expectations
[Assessment Sheet](https://github.com/Lynch08/Fundementals_Of_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20assessment%20sheet.pdf)

## The Repository Content
 - 1 jupyter notebook (numpy-random.ipynb) that holds the explanation, code, visuals and citeations for the assignment.
 - The Assignment details in PDF form from Ian Mcloughlin
 - A requirments.txt file that contains all of the dependancies required to run the assignment in the same environment
 - An Images folder where I have stored some PNG files to display in the notebook
 - A readme file explaining the objectives, outcomes and instructions on how to view the notebook in both editable and static format.
 - nfl.csv a csv file that I read in for one of my plots in pyplot.ipynb
 - IrisdataCSV.csv a csv file of the Iris data set for one of my plots in pyplot.ipynb

##### How to download this repository (editable version)
Go to GitHub.
Go to my repository: https://github.com/Lynch08/Programming_For_Data_Analysis
Click the clone/download button.
Save the repository to a local folder location on your machine.
You will need to navigate to this folder location on the command line in order to run the program.
Details on how to run each individual script in this repository is included later in this Readme file.

##### Running the Jupyter Notebook
On the command line navigate to the folder location where the repository has been downloaded and saved to using the cd command to change directory.
Type jupyter lab on the command line and press enter
After a short wait jupyter notebook will open in your web browser (I would suggest Chrome).
Open the numpy.random.ipynb notebook in the browser and the notebook containing the code and comments that I wrote for this assignment will be displayed.
Before beginning I would suggest going to the Kernel option on the menu bar and if you want to run the notebook yourself choose "Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs". If you want the notebook to run automatically choose "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells"
If you want to run the code in any particular cell, click into the cell, hold down the shift key, press enter and the command will run and the output wil be displayed in the next cell.
To change between edit and read mode at any time press the ESC key.
When you have finished viewing the jupyter notebook close the web browser and return to the command line. Press Ctrl + C on the command line to kill the program.
